ABOUT ME
My name is Stephen. I am a level 26 Bard-Technomancer on an XP grind and searching for a new guild. 
I just started down the Programming sub-class skill tree. Part of me wishes I could reallot some skill points for it, but its fine. I don't need my character to be optimal.
I'm glad I put a single point in the Bard's Carny sub-class tree for the unicycle mount. Sadly, I had a hard time learning the juggling perk.
I also have several points in the Chef class, and its skills synergize with just about every build. However, its perks don't offer any heat resistance, which is a significant hazard in its Guild's enviornment.
